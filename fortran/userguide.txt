INSTRUCTIONS FOR EPHEMERIS FILE ACCESS THROUGH FORTRAN PROGRAMS  - [24 March 2013]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions provide a guide to Fortran programs for converting, merging, 
and reading JPL planetary ephemeris files.  The steps assume downloading of 
ASCII ephemeris files, conversion of ASCII files to binary files, and reading the 
binary files with a test program .

Program "testeph" includes a simple calling program which reads and interpolates 
planetary and lunar coordinates from a binary ephemeris file and compares 
results at specific times against corresponding numbers produced at JPL and 
stored in a file along with the ASCII ephemeris files. Most users will insert 
the ephemeris reading subroutines from "testeph" into their own programs.

The subroutines in "testeph" which read the ephemeris files interpolate the
Chebyshev coefficients for the positions of the planets, Sun, and Moon, which 
are stored in units of kilometers, and scales them by the value of the 
astronomical unit (AU) stored on the ephemeris to return positions in units of AU. 
Users who prefer to units of km will want to use the provided subroutine "CONST"
 to read the value of the AU and scale the positions into kilometers.

These instructions assume the user will start with the ASCII format files. Some
users will be able to skip the step of converting ASCII files to binary files if 
they can find binary files compatible with their system.


FILES TO BE RETRIEVED BY THE USER
------------------------------------

(via anonymous ftp from ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov)

/pub/eph/planets/fortran/asc2eph.f
/pub/eph/planets/fortran/testeph.f

/pub/eph/planets/ascii/deXXX/ascSYYYY.XXX
/pub/eph/planets/ascii/deXXX/testpo.XXX
/pub/eph/planets/ascii/deXXX/header.XXX

where "XXX" is a three-digit number of the desired planetary ephemeris 
(e.g. 403), and "SYYYY" is the starting year of each particular ASCII file 
("S" is the sign : "p" for + and "m" for -).

The ASCII files come in blocks of 20 years or more. The ASCII files are 
converted into binary files on the user's computer, using program "asc2eph".

BRIEF ITEM DESCRIPTION
-----------------------

asc2eph.f      : Program which converts the ASCII ephemeris file into binary
                 format. 

testeph.f      : Fortran program containing a main program which uses the 
                 reading and interpolating subroutines.  This program 
                 compares the results with similar runs made at JPL in order 
                 to ensure that the ephemeris is installed and being read 
                 correctly.

ascSYYYY.XXX   : ASCII ephemeris files from JPL Ephemeris DEXXX,
                 starting in the year SYYYY ("p/m" for  "+/-").  
                 The ASCII ephemeris files may be converted separately 
                 into binary ephemeris files using program "asc2eph" 
                 or several ASCII ephemeris files can be input at one time 
                 into "asc2eph" to make a longer binary file.

header.XXX : Header information for ephemeris deXXX, needed by "asc2eph".

testpo.XXX"    : Test results computed at JPL; these are input by the program
                 testeph and are used for testing the ephemeris 
                 installation.  There is a different test file for each 
                 ephemeris; they must match or the test will not 
                 work correctly.

******************************************************************************

ASCII to BINARY CONVERSION
--------------------------

To convert the ASCII blocks into a binary ephemeris, you must first 
compile and run the program "asc2eph".  Before compiling "asc2eph.f" the user
must edit the program to select length of a Fortran direct access record on the users
platform by uncommentting one of the lines which specify the parameter 'NRECL'.
The program "asc2eph" reads, via standard input, a header file followed by 
one or more of the ASCII ephemeris blocks. 
Thus, the input is "header.XXX" and (a series of) "ascSYYYY.XXX".  (The "S" 
stands for the "sign": "p" for "+";"m" for "-".)  The blocks must be in order 
with no gaps in the intervals of time-coverage.  The binary ephemeris is written
onto a file called 'JPLEPH'.

An example for running asc2eph on a PC is the following:

    C:\> copy header.200+ascp1980.200+ascp2000.200+ascp2020.200  infile.200
    C:\> asc2eph < infile.200

In UNIX, one would use:

    cat header.200 ascp1980.200 ascp2000.200 ascp2020.200 | asc2eph.e


TESTING THE BINARY FILE
-----------------------

To check that the conversion from ASCII to binary ephemeris file has been done 
successfully, the program, "testeph" is provided.  This program reads 
ephemeris positions and compares the results with values computed at JPL, 
contained in the file "testpo.XXX".

Compilation of the program "testeph" requires tailoring of source code to work 
on the users computer, since the program uses a native binary Fortran read 
function that is implemented differently on different platforms. Instructions on 
the required tailoring are given below.

After compilation, running program "testeph" requires assigning the name 
"JPLEPH" to the binary ephemeris file and sending "testpo.XXX" to 
the executable via standard input. An example under the UNIX command line is after 
creating the binary JPLEPH file from the DE200 ASCCI filers as described above is:

    cat testpo.200 | testeph.e

The program "testeph" will print out the list of ephemeris constants
(retrieved by the subroutine "CONST") and will then use the subroutine
"PLEPH" to read and interpolate the ephemeris for coordinates
corresponding to the sample ones in "testpo.xxx".  If any comparison
yields a difference larger than 10**(-13) [in units of au or au/day],
an error message will be printed out.  Further, a line will be printed
every 100 comparisons in any case, so that the progress can be monitored.


TAILORING THE SOFTWARE
----------------------

The software was written in standard Fortran-77.  It should work on 
any machine with a standard compiler.  

HOWEVER, there are two parameters, NRECL, and KSIZE which must be defined
by the user by editing the program before compilation.

These parameters are set by the subroutine FSIZER1, FSIZER2, or FSIZER3.
The user must determine which of these three subroutines is appropriate,
select which is used by uncomenting the relevant line in the subroutine "STATE",
comment lines needing values in the two non-used versions, and adding the correct
values in the version selected.

Records are stored on some platforms in single precison words (in which case NRECL = 1)
or in bytes (in which case NRECL = 4). The user must select the correct value when
editing the selected version of FSIZER.

Each record of the binary ephemeris file has a length of KSIZE single precision words.
KSIZE is not the same for each ephemeris. The three different versions of FSIZER
determine KSIZE in different ways.

FSIZER1     Uses the INQUIRE statement to find the length of the records
            automatically before opening the file.  This works for VAX's;
            not in UNIX.

FSIZER2     Opens the file with a large arbitrary value of RECL, reads the first
            record, and use the information on that record to determine the 
            recordn length.  FSIZER2 then closes the file and passes the correct
            value of KSIZE to the subroutinte STATE to re-open with the 
            exact value. This seems to work for UNIX compilers as long as the 
            initial value of RECL is less than the exact value but large enough 
            to get the required information from the first file.
            (For other compilers, this doesn't work since you can open a file 
            only with the exact value of RECL.)

FSIZER3     The user enters a fixed value for KSIZE based on the ephemeris file ins use.
            KSIZE is 1652 for DE200, 2036 for DE4xx except DE406 for which KSIZE = 1456..

The selected version of FSIZER also defines the file name Fortran unit number
the binary ephemeris, which iare 12 and 'JPLEPH' respectively by default but can 
be changed by the user if desired.

MAIN READING SUBROUTINES
------------------------

Two of the subroutines called by "testeph.f" are of primary interest to the user:
"PLEPH" and "CONST". Subroutines "DPLEPH", and "STATE" may also be useful.

   PLEPH  :  Get the state vector (position and velocity) of one body with 
              respect to another at any given time within the interval covered 
              by the ephemeris.

   CONST  :  Retrieve values of all of the constants on the ephemeris file.

   DPLEPH :  Same as PLEPH, but with increased precision in the input time.

   STATE  :  Read and interpolate the ephemeris file. (Called by PLEPH).


C  NOTE : Over the years, different versions of PLEPH have had a 5th argument:
C  sometimes, an error return statement number; sometimes, a logical denoting
C  whether or not the requested date is covered by the ephemeris.  We apologize
C  for this inconsistency; in this version, we use only the four necessary
C  arguments and do the testing outside of the subroutine.


**  PLEPH  ********  subroutine pleph( tdb, npl, nctr, pv)  **********

    Input
    -----
          tdb [d.p.]  : julian ephemeris date

                 (for nutations and librations, nctr=0)
    Output
    ------
          pv(6) [d.p.]  : x,y,z,x-dot,y-dot,z-dot [au, au/day]
                  for nutations, d(psi), d(eps), d(psi)-dot, d(eps)-dot
                                  [rads, rads/day]
                  for librations, (Euler angles and rates, w.r.t. the ephemeris
                                  reference frame)   [rads, rads/day]

**  CONST  ********  subroutine const(nmv,vlv,sss,nrv)  **********

    Input   (none)
    -----

    Output
    ------
     nmv(nrv) [char*6] : list of nrv names associated with the values in vlv
     vlv(nrv) [d.p.]   : nrv values associated with the names in nmcc
     sss(3) [d.p.]     :
                            sss(1) : starting jed of the ephemeris file
                            sss(2) : ending jed of the ephemeris file
                            sss(3) : number of days covered by each block
                                     of Chebychev coefficients
     nrv [int.]        : number of values in nmv and vlv



**  STATE  ********  subroutine state(jed,list,pv,nut,*)  **********
           
  [This subroutine is identical to that provided in the past; it is still 
   provided to give previous users compatability; it is not recommended for 
   use by first-time users.]
                                                                     
**  DPLEPH  ********  entry dpleph( tdb2, npl, nctr, pv)  **********

  This entry is identical to "PLEPH", except that the input time, tdb2, is

  doubly-dimensioned for increased precision  [ double precision tdb2(2) ].

                          Any combination of tdb2(1)+tdb2(2) which falls within
                          the time span on the file is a permissible epoch.    

                                                                               
                          For ease in programming, the user may put the entire 
                          date into tdb2(1) and set tdb2(2)=0.        

                          However, for maximum interpolation accuracy, set 
                          tdb2(1) equal to the most recent midnight at or 
                          before interpolation epoch (i.e., xxxxxxx.5d0) and 
                          set tdb2(2) equal to the remaining fractional part 

                          of the day.

                          As an alternative, it may prove convenient to set 
                          tdb2(1) equal to some fixed epoch, such as start of 
                          integration, and set tdb2(2) equal to the remainder 
                          of the desired epoch.
